<h2>quotes</h2>
<ul>
<li>"In my opinion, the most powerful weapon you have is the weapon of truth and justice, and you should never create a situation where you can be silenced on the grounds of feelings and emotions." -- <a href="https://youtu.be/pT-Qy4mpEg0?t=19652">Norman Gary Finkelstein</a></li>
<li>"I will not serve that in which I no longer believe, whether it call itself my home, my fatherland, or my church: and I will try to express myself in some mode of life or art as freely as I can and as wholly as I can, using for my defence the only arms I allow myself to use‚Å†&mdash;silence, exile and cunning." -- <a href="https://standardebooks.org/ebooks/james-joyce/a-portrait-of-the-artist-as-a-young-man">Stephen Dedalus in James Joyce's <i>A Portrait of the Artist as a Young Man</i></a></li>

<li>"I find it wholesome to be alone the greater part of the time. To be in company, even with the best, is soon wearisome and dissipating. I love to be alone. I never found the companion that was so companionable as solitude." -- <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/205">Henry David Thoreau</a></li>

<li>"What you do is all that matters. Philosophy is irrelevant except for the actions that result from it, and study is a poor subsitute [<i>sic</i>] for curiosity." -- <a href="https://keonigandall.com/pages/recommendations.html">Keoni Gandall</a></li>

<ul><li>This is my initial misreading of <a href="https://quoteinvestigator.com/2019/02/08/joke/">George Orwell's quote</a> "Every joke is a tiny revolution." I prefer this misreading to the original quote, and the meaning behind the misreading is similar to <a href="https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/there%27s_a_grain_of_truth_in_every_joke">"there's a grain of truth in every joke."</a></li></ul>

The closest edition that I found was <a href="https://archive.thehockeynews.com/issue/607670">January 14, 1983</a>. <a href="https://archive.thehockeynews.com/year/1983">(archived 1983 editions)</a> Feel free to contact me if you have more information.</li>
<li>"My dad [Walter Gretzky] says 100 percent of the shots you don't take don't go in" -- Wayne Gretzky <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/1996/05/11/sports/nhl-playoffs-blues-shut-out-red-wings.html">(source 1)</a> <a href="https://www.spokesman.com/stories/1996/may/11/gretzky-plays-the-heavy-in-1-0-win/">(source 2)</a></li></ul>

<li>"There was a story in my days about a physical chemist who was asked to explain some effect, illustrated by a poster on the wall. He did that, after which someone noticed that the poster was hanging upside down, so the effect appeared reversed in sign. Undaunted, the guy immediately explained it the other way around, just as convincingly as he did the first time." -- <a href="https://chemistry.stackexchange.com/a/60876">Ivan Neretin</a></li>
